- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChrisR95
- 👀 I’m interested in finding my way in python, exploring data fields and eventually hoping to work with AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of Python. It's a start :) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a lot but I think there is more for me to learn here then the other way around!
- 📫 How to reach me: You can probably send some sort of message through Github. I'm honestly new and have no idea yet :) 

Thanks to everybody out here sharing knowledge and helping eachother out! Maybe one day i'll be able to repay the favor to some stranger :)
